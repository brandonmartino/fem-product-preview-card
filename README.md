## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- LESS and worked with CSS transitions at 1280px
- CSS Grid (first time using in a project)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I attempted to utilize grid for the first time. This seemed more simple than flex-box (which is usually what I prefer). Once I moved on to the desktop version of this project card, my image would not fill the entire area of the right section of the card. I realized, probably for this project only, I needed to place the display: grid on the entire body. I think this could have been placed on the section id I used, but for the sake of this project, it was a quick fix.

Also attempted some CSS transitions and transforms to help animate the button on hover (ease dark green) and a scale vector on the card with some box shadow to show some interactive elements to the card.

### Continued development

I plan to continue using CSS transitions to improve UX. The more I use these and get comfortable, the better I will begin to see animations and understand what they are using to achieve a certain effect.
